to predict the student leave with assist from the student attendance database.
Building a Student Leave Prediction  Using Machine Learning And Compare Different Model** 

This Notebook compares the performance and root square value of 7 different types of machine learning algorithms for prediction on same dataset with Exploratory Data Analysis done.The goal is to present to you the 7 popular prediction Algorithms.In this notebook we will have the algorithms below:


*   Linear Regression
*   ElasticNet Regression	
*   Support Vector Machines(SVM)
*   Random Forest
*   Extra Tree
*   Gradient Boosted
*   Baseline


Conclusion: As we see both Model Mean Absolute Error & Model Root Mean Squared Error that the linear regression is performing the best in both cases
